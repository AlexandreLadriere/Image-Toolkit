I often need to quickly resize or crop images. In order to do that, I used to use an online converter/tool. 
However, sometimes I don't have an Internet connection, so I decided to develop my own tool (and also because I have nothing else to do during this Covid-19 crisis).

Currently, you can:
- Resize an image
- Crop an image
- Rotate an image

These are the supported format:
- ``.png``
- ``.bmp``
- ``.jpg``
- ``.jpeg``
- (``.gif`` might be added later)
